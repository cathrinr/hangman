# Hangman Game

I created a simple hangman game as a first little project in python. 
You will get six chances to guess a secret word, that is chosen from a list of words. When you guessed a correct character your chance will not be counted. When you entereda  wrong character your chances will be reduced by one. The game covers all the input mistakes and does a automated restart after one game.

Have fun playing it!
